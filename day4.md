 100 Days Challenge - Day 4.
K-Means Clustering (with FIFA 19 Dataset Project)

Dec 6


Revised Clustering from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera which I had already completed a few months ago and worked on FIFA 19 dataset to cluster a set of top football players (using FIFA 19 in-game stats) into 4 classes expecting the clusters to reflect on the position, style and quality of play.


Topics covered include:


K Means Clustering

    Algorithm
    Optimization Objective
    Choosing number of Clusters

Results: 


The last column shows the cluster corresponding to each player and as expected, the goalkeepers are grouped together in De Gea cluster. Ramos cluster includes all defenders and two defensive midfielders. Wingers and a few strikers have found their way into the Messi cluster. De Bruyne cluster has all kinds of attacking minded players which is kind of hard to interpret. I will try to expand this project later on and experiment with more players and more classes.
