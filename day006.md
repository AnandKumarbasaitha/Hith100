 100 Days Challenge - Day 6.
Anomaly Detection (Credit Card Fraud Project)

Dec 8
Revised Anomaly Detection  from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera which I had already completed a few months ago and started working on Credit Card Transaction Dataset to detect fraudulent transactions.

Topics covered include:


Anomaly Detection

    Normal Assumption
    Algorithm
    Evaluation
    Choosing Features
    Anomaly Detection vs Supervised Learning
    Anomaly Detection using Multivariate Normal

Note: I have started the project but there were some issues due to which the predictions came out erroneously. Will fix it soon and upload the python notebook file in tomorrow's post.
